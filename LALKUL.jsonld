    "motivations": "Our motivation to be a DRep comes from the belief that the DRep role requires a range of skills that one individual cannot fulfill as effectively as a close-knit team. Currently, there is no clear framework to address this concern within the CIP-1694 DRep program, and we are committed to filling that gap.\n\nOur goal is to create a team-based DRep model, sharing our knowledge of sociocratic governance and community-building to ensure governance decisions are informed, diverse, and resilient. We believe collaboration, not individualism, is key to building a stronger Cardano.",
    "objectives": "The L∀LKUL DRep is a decentralized governance framework designed to enhance representation in Cardano’s on-chain governance. We aim to model exceptional Delegated Representation, offering tools, education, and support for meaningful participation in governance.\n\nWe invite the Cardano community to engage in various roles. As an expert, we welcome your participation in a subcircle focused on establishing policies and decisions. As a collaborator, we look forward to working cooperatively with other Cardano DReps.\n\nOur Objectives:\n- Inclusive Decision-Making: Create an open space for diverse participation and empower new members with education and tools.\n- Expert-Led Governance: Ensure informed decision-making through subcircles with domain-specific expertise.\n- Resilient Governance: Continuously adapt governance by integrating community feedback.\n- Community Engagement: Build transparency and close the gap between DReps and the community through continuous feedback loops.",

    "qualifications": "As a diverse group, our qualifications for the DRep role span multiple disciplines essential for effective governance. Our team includes economists, governance experts, community builders, developers, humanists, scientists, mathematicians, engineers etc.",
