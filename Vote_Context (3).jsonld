    "comment": "Lalkul is voting NO on this proposal to reduce the Net Change Limit (NCL) to 200 million ADA. A limit of 350 million ADA has already been approved for 2025, and introducing repeated changes to this parameter without clear urgency creates unnecessary churn in the governance process.\nAs active DReps, we have already begun evaluating and approving a number of budget items within the context of the previously established 350 million ADA limit. Reducing the NCL by such a significant margin midway through this process creates additional complexity and undermines the consistency needed for informed decision-making. It is both operationally cumbersome and procedurally disruptive.\nWhile we are not opposed to a future reduction in the NCL, a more structured and gradual approach would better serve the goals of stability and effective treasury management."
